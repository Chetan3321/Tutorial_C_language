# Introduction 
C is a powerful and widely-used programming
language, renowned for its performance, portability, and versatility.
Whether you\'re aiming for systems programming, embedded development, or
general software engineering, understanding C will provide a solid
foundation.

In this tutorial, we cover everything from the basics to more advanced
topics, complete with hands-on examples and exercises.

# Setup
Environment Configuration To begin coding in C, you\'ll need to
set up a development environment:

* Install a C compiler: We recommend GCC or Clang. 
* Choose an IDE: Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or Eclipse.
* Command Line Interface: Learn how to compile and run C programs via the
terminal.
Refer to the setup guide for detailed instructions on getting
started.

# Basics 

Learn the fundamentals of C programming, including:

* Data types: int, char, float, double, etc.
* Operators: Arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operations.
* Control flow: if statements, loops (for, while, do-while).
* Syntax: Understand the structure of a basic C program.

Explore the basics section for examples
and exercises.

# Control Structures 

In this section, we dive deeper into:
* Conditionals: if-else, switch statements.
* Loops: for, while, do-while.
* Break & Continue: Controlling the flow within loops.

Visit the control structures tutorial to learn how to write efficient and clean code.

# Functions 

Learn how to modularize your code using functions:
* Function declarations and definitions. 
* Recursion: Solve problems with recursive functions.
* Scope: Understand variable scope in C.

Check out the functions guide for detailed examples.

# Pointers & Memory Management 

A crucial aspect of C programming is understanding pointers and memory:
* Pointers: Declare and use pointers effectively.
* Pointer arithmetic: Navigate through arrays using pointer math.
* Dynamic memory allocation: Manage memory with malloc, calloc, realloc, and free.

Head over to the pointers and memory management section for more.

# Data Structures 

Master the implementation of basic data structures in C:

* Arrays: Static and dynamic arrays.
* Linked Lists: Singly and doubly linked lists.
* Stacks & Queues: Stack and queue implementations.

Start implementing data structures by exploring the data structures tutorials.

# File I/O 

Learn how to perform file operations in C:
* Reading from files: fopen, fscanf, fgets.
* Writing to files: fprintf, fputc.
* File handling functions: fclose, fseek, ftell.

Go through the file I/O section for examples on how to work with files.
